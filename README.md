# AtmosPy-Monitor: Real-Time Temperature, Pressure, and Altitude Monitoring

This project provides real-time monitoring of temperature, pressure, and altitude using an Arduino and ESP8266 setup. The data is collected from sensors and displayed through the Arduino IoT Cloud platform.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Collects and displays environmental data every 5 minutes.
- **Cloud-Based Dashboard**: Accessible from anywhere for live and historical data.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 95% sensor accuracy through calibration.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino
- ESP8266
- BMP180/BMP280 sensors (for temperature, pressure, and altitude)

## Setup Instructions
Refer to the [setup guide](docs/setup_guide.md) to get started with hardware connections and Arduino IoT Cloud integration.
